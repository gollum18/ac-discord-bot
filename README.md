# Action Castle Discord Bot
A Discord bot that allows servers to play Action Castle.

## What eactly is Action Castle?
Action Castle is an ongoing TV series whereby the host runs contestants through a Parseley Games text-adventure. Basically, contestants take turns deciding the actions of a single character to acheive some goal. The game features what you would expect from a basic adventure game such as interacting with the game world, saving and loading, etc... Overall, it is a lot of fun and is great to play at parties and the like.
